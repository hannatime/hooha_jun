    <br>
    <p>We've spent a lot of time debating the merits of the current CRM tools available today. As a team we feel they're bloated and focus too much on being great sales management tools, rather than great sales tools. So we came up with Hooha.</p>

    <p>It's simple, works brilliantly on mobile, and helps salespeople manage tasks, opportunities, contacts, and accounts. It's all salespeople need, and nothing more.</p>
    <p>Give it a try, and let us know what you think.</p>

          <h4>Accounts</h4>
          <p>The business or entity you are selling to.</p>
          <p>In Hooha, everything belongs to an account, they are the master entity, and you'll need to create them first. If your selling to an individual and not a business, use the contact name instead.</p>

        <div class ="col-sm-3"> 
           <div class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-group fa-3x"></i></div>
          <h4>Contacts</h4>
          <p>The individual you are selling to and their details.</p>
          <p>Contacts aren't essential, however it is good sales practice to know who belongs to an account, and who is aligned to an opportunity.</p>

           <div class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-dollar fa-3x"></i></div>
          <h4>Opportunities</h4>
          <p>What are you selling, how much for and when it will close.</p>
          <p>The opportunity sits at the core of any selling process. Within the opportunity you track; contacts (if applicable), the amount, the stage, the probability of closing the deal, and the expected closing date.</li>

          <h4>Tasks</h4>
          <p>The actions you need to take to make the sale.</p>
          <p>Tracking tasks inside a CRM makes good sense, it's easier to keep all your sales focused activity in one place.</p>
