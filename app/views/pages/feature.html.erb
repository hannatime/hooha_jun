  <h1>CRM built for salespeople</h1>
  <p>We've spent a lot of time debating the merits of the current CRM tools available today. As a team we feel they're bloated and focus too much on being great sales management tools, rather than great sales tools. So we came up with Hooha.</p>

  <p>It's simple, works brilliantly on mobile, and helps salespeople manage tasks, opportunities, contacts, and accounts. It's all salespeople need, and nothing more.</p>
