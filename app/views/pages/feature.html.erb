    <h1>CRM built for salespeople</h1>
    <br>
    <p>We've spent a lot of time debating the merits of the current CRM tools available today. As a team we feel they're bloated and focus too much on being great sales management tools, rather than great sales tools. So we came up with Hooha.</p>

    <p>It's simple, works brilliantly on mobile, and helps salespeople manage tasks, opportunities, contacts, and accounts. It's all salespeople need, and nothing more.</p>
    <p>Give it a try, and let us know what you think.</p>

          <h4>Accounts</h4>
          <p>The business or entity you are selling to.</p>
          <p>In Hooha, everything belongs to an account, they are the master entity, and you'll need to create them first. If your selling to an individual and not a business, use the contact name instead.</p>
